Provided are the Files Collected on the experiment ran on 12/05/23 at Farmingdale State College. 



This study experimented with and collected data to get a further understanding of the ongoing effort of the Multipath Transmission Control Protocol, or MPTCP. As new technologies are developed, it is becoming more common to have devices connected to multiple networks. MPTCP is being researched, enabling simultaneous use of multiple paths within a TCP connection for device communication. 
 The development of MPTCP has many potential advantages, such as better speeds and throughput as well as more dependable and stable connections between devices. This study aimed to collect data for analysis from Wi-Fi and 4G/5G cellular networks independently of each other's connections.






We share Wi-Fi and cellular trace pairs for different paths and the trials along each path. Figure 2 shows the result of the Farmingdale Wi-Fi and Figure 3 shows the result of the device T-Mobile 5G device. The data in the figures displays the number of bytes that were transferred during a specified period during the download of a file using the command-line tool WGET from a source IP address (128.110.219.103) to the destination. These intervals give information about the file's transfer rate over time, which is useful for diagnosing problems with network performance and seeing variations. The full statistics show if the transfer was constant during the gigabyte file download using WGET, or whether there were times when the transfer rate was abnormally high or low such as in Figure 1.

The study's findings may provide important new understandings of the efficacy of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) techniques, particularly when it comes to leveraging Wi-Fi and cellular networks concurrently and meeting the demand for dependable and effective network communication in different settings and environments.​
These results could be used to enhance network performance and reliability, which could help with real-world problems like seamless Wi-Fi to cellular network transitions and enhance user experience for online gaming, streaming videos, and web browsing.​
The findings may offer a comprehensive evaluation of MPTCP's efficacy in network scenarios where a set of wireless link traces measured concurrently on a mobile device's cellular and Wi-Fi interfaces are gathered.
